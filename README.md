# Eight-Ball-Plus V80
Bally Eight Ball rules rewrite, all files

New for version 80:  

Extended Bank Shot functions allowing up to 10x Bonus Multiplier
Increased display of gamer timers.
Pre ball display of achieved goals.

This set of files works with the current BallySternOS.  You can either download the files OS specific files included in this repository or use the ones from the main repository.  If this is your first time doing this, just download everything in the Eight Ball Plus repository.
The file "Prepare your pinball for use with BSOS.pdf" is a complete set of instructions for downloading everything you need and preparing your machine to use the new Eight Ball Plus code.

You can download all files together.  if using V80, delete the ".....V75.ino" file or vice versa.  You can only have 1 in your directory.  The directory you place all files in must have the same name as the ".............Vxx" file you are using for the Arduino software to work.

Known shortcomings (as of 220321):
  Will not work with Weebly replacement MPU cards.  Tested to date on an Alltek replacement MPU and an original Bally AS-2518-35 MPU.
